    structured nodes/edges with stable ids, which the frontend renders as SVG so
    it can animate files joining the diagram as an import progresses. Both are
    derived from the stored manifest, so the output is deterministic and needs no
    clone or LLM call.

    live preview built from the files already represented in the index (a
    transient manifest, never persisted). ``progress`` describes how far the
    import has got so the frontend can poll and animate files joining in.
